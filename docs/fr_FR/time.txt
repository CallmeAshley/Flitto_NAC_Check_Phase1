[Time Format]
Evaluation Criteria:
- French uses the 24-hour clock in all written contexts.  
- There is no AM/PM indicator.  
- Both colon format (`14:30`) and 'h' format (`14h30`, `16h00`) are acceptable in French.

Examples:  
- 16h00  
- 14h30  
- 22:15

[Exceptions]
-For duration expressions, such as "1 hour 30 minutes", do not convert to clock-based time formats like 01:30.
Instead, retain natural French expressions such as 1h30 or 1 heure 30 minutes depending on register.
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the Source and Translated sentence before making changes.
