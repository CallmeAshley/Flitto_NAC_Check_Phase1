[Time Format]
Evaluation Criteria:  
- In 12-hour format, include 오전 or 오후 before the hour.  
- In 24-hour format, use colons (`:`).

Examples:  
- 오전 9시 30분, 오후 2시  
- 09:30, 14:00  

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the Source and Translated sentence before making changes.
