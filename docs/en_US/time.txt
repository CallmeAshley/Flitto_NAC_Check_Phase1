[Time Format]
Evaluation Criteria:  
- Include `AM(am)` or `PM(pm)` after the time.  
- Use colons between hours, minutes, and seconds.  

Examples:  
- 2:30 PM  
- 4:30 pm
- 2:30:45 PM  
- 8:11:22 am

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the Source and Translated sentence before making changes.
