[Date Format]
American English uses the Month → Day → Year order.  
Slashes (`/`) or commas (`,`) may be used depending on the format style.  
If a weekday is included, place it before the date and separate it with a comma.  
Maintain ordinal suffixes (e.g., 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th') in date expressions only if they appear explicitly in the source text.

Examples:  
- Monday, July 28, 2025  
- July 28, 2025  
- Jul 28, 2025  
- 7/28/25

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
